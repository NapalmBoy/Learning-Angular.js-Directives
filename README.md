# Learning AngularJS Directives[Video]
This is the code repository for [Learning AngularJS Directives[Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/learning-angularjs-directivesvideo?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785287329), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
It can be hard to maintain a balance between visual elements of an application associated with HTML and CSS and aspects such as UI Interaction and form validation. Wouldn’t it be great if you could use HTML as your own domain specific language (DSL) and have it be a custom thing tuned exactly to the elements and attributes you need for the project you’re building?

AngularJS provides this exact solution by separating these two features so that you can make changes in the visual layout without affecting your code. Backed by directives, AngularJS will help you to add functionality to HTML so that you can build interactive, engaging web applications.

Directives help you to extend your HTML and teach it new tricks to visually enhance your websites without compromising your code. This video course covers everything you need to use directives in your own apps, from creating directives to isolating their scope, applying transclusion, and injecting dependencies.

Firstly, we will learn how to include HTML snippets in our code using directives and create a directive to start working with it. We will use isolate scope to configure our directives individually and style them. Next, we will take a look at different operators to bind functions and make our directives interactive. We will explore the concept of transclusion and apply it to make our code more effective. Once we’ve done this, we will restrict our directives to be used as an element, attribute, class or a comment according to our needs. We will also discover the difference between link and controller functions and inject dependencies to create testable components and co-ordinate our directives to work together. By the end of this course, you’ll be proficient with creating and using fully functional directives to your advantage.

CryENGINE 3 SDK Level Design covers various aspects of level design while informing the budding designer of ways to achieve their goals with less effort. Even with no prior knowledge of game design, CryENGINE 3 SDK Level Design will show you everything you need to know about game level design, starting from how to load the CryENGINE 3 SDK on to your PC all the way to packing up your first level to play.

In order to make your game level look presentable, the course starts off by helping you get a grasp on the basics, such as creating your first level, working with models, terrain creation, and material editing. However, your journey doesn't stop there, as you will then gain further knowledge of more advanced features such as creating flowgraphs and particles, adding sound, and debugging your level.

By the end of this course, you will be armed with the skills you need to start creating game levels and scenes. While watching these videos, you will learn game creation tactics that not only work for the CryENGINE, but also for most modern day game engines.

Code bundle of this course comes along with the game created in the video course with the CryENGINE Free SDK Version 3.4.5
